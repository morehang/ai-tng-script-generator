# AI TNG Script Generator

## Overview

This repository is focused on developing an enhanced version of a text generation tool that generates scripts for the TV series, 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'. The final specific part includes the implementation of a mobile application using Flutter and necessary shifts in the backend logic for this support.

We are proud to note that this project was featured in a Machine Learning App Examples video on YouTube.

## MVP Use Case

The MVP intends to serve as a tool supplying AI-generated transcripts of brand new episodes of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'. It can be utilized by creative writers in the industry to generate prompts for writing. A demo video showcasing the functionality is available on YouTube.

The user interaction includes user login via Google OAuth, ordering of a new AI-generated transcript, entering payment details, and subsequently getting access to the generated script. However, the MVP version has certain limitations such as simplistic user management, simple UI/UX, lack of persistence of generated scripts, etc. More details on these can be found in the readme.

## Future Developments

Future adaptations could include advanced user management options, enhanced UI/UX, support for persistence of generated scripts, and scalability options.

## Realization Steps and Building the Project

The steps to realize the project, model training, implementations of backend and frontend, are mentioned in the project readme. The build steps require installation of Node modules and Python packages, adjustment of system configuration, and usage of the Docker image. For user authentication, Google OAuth settings need to be adjusted accordingly.

## Licensing

The project is available under the terms of the MIT license.
